# amnh-zeiss-utils
Utilities for handling Zeiss txm and txrm files

## Requirements

This repo contains a `amnh-zeiss-utils.yaml` file for creating an environment with the required packages (and some extras that were used in development, such as Jupyter notebook support). In particular, `xrmreader` is required, along with anything else that it requires. 

## Known issues

The "Objective" field in the txrm file is not yet handled.
